## Context
[CLICK HERE](https://jonchristieportfolio.herokuapp.com/) to check out my portfolio. As expected you will find some of my work as a full stack developer, mostly at this point comprising of projects and assignments from bootcamp along with my own side-projects. I am just now, in the August of 2020, finishing up with bootcamp but come with years of experience in education, sales, customer service, and even a few years as a web developer. Enjoy and use the contact info to get in touch with me about any positions or freelance work you would like to discuss.
